# About

Welcome! I'm a second-year master student at [SoC(School of Computing)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [NUS(National University of Singapore)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). <br>
I'm affiliated to [WING (Web Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing Group)](https://www.wing.nus.edu.sg/). <br>
I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy) and [Dr. Wenqiang Lei](https://sites.google.com/view/wenqianghome/home). <br>
My office is on level 5 of AS6 building. <br><br>
My <b>long-term goal</b> is to push the research boundary of interaction between AI and humanity (including history, literature, music and other forms of arts), and answer a basic question: how we human perceive beauty. To achieve this <b>long-term goal</b>, I not only conduct novel research as introduced in the next section, but also initiate [UCMW project](UCMW/index) purely out of my personal interest.
