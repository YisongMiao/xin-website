# UCMW (You See My World)

[Link to Yisong's Personal website ](http://www.yisong.me/)

This project is conducted purely out of my personal interest. 

The first intuition is to provide a solution to the long-distance relationship I have with Xin. I want her to enjoy this relationship as if we are *physically* together: be able to see the surroundings of mine, to breathe the humanity around me, to sense the happiness and pain of mine, basically she can *sync* with me.

I later realized this idea resonates with what Ray Dalio claims in *Principle*, that being transparent is the key to meaningful human relationships.

Another significance is that it can leads to better time management: when we use UCMW to look back, we will have a sense how we distribute our time/energy/passion, and learn from our past expereince.

Therefore I propose a system that can seamlessly achieve following two goals.



## Goal 1. Fundamental

The system is able to automatically record following things with timestamps:

- The places I've been to
- The human conversation I have
- The idea bounces in my mind
- The goal/purpose of my day and how I accomplish it
- The book/article/music that I dive into.

After these information are automatically collected, the system is able to generate a summary which is interesting and insightful. After the generation process, the system then post it to my friends.

It is worth noting that we combine multi-modal information, including text, pictures, music... Basically all the senses human can perceive.

To achieve this, luckily the information mentioned above can be automatically obtained by integrating multi-sensor, like Apple Watch, Camera, screenshots from Macbooks...



## Goal 2. Progressive

The system is able to provide insight to the life I had in a lag of time, provide comparison and improvement for following aspects:

- Time management and productivity.
- Healthy lifestyle.
- The inner growth that I make: what I learn, what idea I'm thinking about. 
- The progress and distance towards my short-term and long-term goals.

To achieve this, we need to transfer these un-structured information types into more structured ones at the first step.

Yisong is thinking about following steps... 



## Seeking collaborations

If you're interested to work on this project with me, and be **co-dreamers** with  me, don't hesitate to contact me via email! [email address](miaoyisong@gmail.com)

I believe this project is fun, and impactful. Upon accomplished, it will not only provide a bridge for thousands of people to connect their friends, but also give us a chance to do a self-UCMW :D
